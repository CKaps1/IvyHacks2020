# Project Overview - CoLinkEd

# Problem:
 Students with special needs have always had a hard time not only interacting with other students in their environment, but learning at the same pace as other students. With the COVID-19 pandemic, special needs education has only become more challenging for parents, students, and teachers. 

# Solution:
	CoLinkEd works with parents and students to conveniently provide education tailored to their needs. Educators are able to register as verified CoLinkEd partners through a rigorous application process. Once verified, parents and students are able to connect with appropriate specialized instructors.
	Instructors are paid of course, and CoLinkEd is a paid service.
